## Working agreement (binding rule)

**Every meaningful change to this project MUST be followed by:**

1. **Update `nd.md`** — adjust the relevant section so the project handoff stays the source of truth.
2. **Update `AGENTS.md`** — if a convention, hard stop, or "where things live" pointer changed.
3. **Run the full verification suite** before committing:
   - `cd backend && python -m pytest -q && python manage.py check`
   - `cd frontend && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`
4. **Commit with a Conventional Commit message** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
5. **Push to `origin/main`** at https://github.com/prarit0097/Nirogidhara-AI-Command-Center.

The remote on GitHub must mirror local state at the end of every working session. Non-negotiable.

**Meaningful change** = any code edit, new endpoint/model/migration/service/page, env var, dependency, or onboarding-doc change.
**Not meaningful** = read-only exploration or reverted experiments.

**Never without explicit user authorization**: force-push to `main`, rewrite pushed history (`commit --amend`, `rebase -i`), skip hooks (`--no-verify`), commit secrets.

## Hard stops (compliance — never bypass)

This codebase serves an Ayurvedic medicine business. Some rules are non-negotiable:

1. **No free-style medical claims.** AI may only emit content from `apps.compliance.Claim` (the Approved Claim Vault). Hard-coded medical strings in code are forbidden.
2. **Blocked claim phrases — do not generate, hard-code, or seed:**
   - "Guaranteed cure"
   - "Permanent solution"
   - "No side effects for everyone"
   - "Works for all people universally"
   - "Doctor ki zarurat nahi"
   - Any "cures X disease" claim without doctor approval
   - Emergency medical advice
3. **CAIO Agent never executes business actions.** It monitors / audits / suggests only. If you find code wiring a CAIO endpoint to a write path, that's a bug — fix it.
4. **CEO AI is the execution approval layer.** Low/medium-risk actions go through it. High-risk actions go to **Prarit Sidana** (final authority).
5. **Every important state change writes an `AuditEvent`** (Master Event Ledger). Add a `post_save` receiver in `apps/audit/signals.py` for any new state-bearing model.
6. **Reward/penalty is based on delivered profitable orders**, not order-punching count.
7. **Human call recordings must not auto-train live AI.** They go through QA → Compliance → CAIO audit → Sandbox → CEO approval first.
8. **Frontend never holds business logic.** All calculations with business meaning live in Django services.
9. **AI Kill Switch, Sandbox Mode, Rollback System, Approval Matrix** are mandatory before any production rollout.
10. **Future Android/iOS apps must use the same backend APIs.** Don't fork business logic into mobile clients.
11. **AI provider keys live in `backend/.env` only** (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GROK_API_KEY`). Read them through `apps._ai_config.current_config()`. Never hard-code, never log them, never expose them to the frontend. When wiring Phase 3 LLM calls, every prompt MUST inject relevant `apps.compliance.Claim` entries before reaching the model — see rule #1.

## Architecture rule

```
React UI  ──/api/JSON──►  Django + DRF  ──ORM──►  SQLite (dev) / Postgres (prod)
   │                          │
   │                          │ post_save signals
   │                          ▼
   │                   audit.AuditEvent  ← Master Event Ledger
   │
   └── mock fallback ── frontend/src/services/mockData.ts
       (offline-safe; pages never break if backend is down)
```

- **Frontend → backend** flows through one file: `frontend/src/services/api.ts`. Never call `mockData.ts` directly from a page.
- **Backend → frontend** uses camelCase JSON keys (Django serializers map snake_case columns via `source=`).
- **Pages** (`frontend/src/pages/*.tsx`) consume `api` only. **Never** import `mockData.ts` from a page.
- **No `{success, data}` envelope** — endpoints return raw arrays/objects matching `frontend/src/types/domain.ts`.

## Conventions

### Python / Django

- Pin `Django>=5.0,<5.2`, `Python>=3.10`.
- Snake_case in Python and DB. Use `source=` mapping in serializers to expose camelCase keys.
- DRF `ViewSet`s with `mixins.ListModelMixin` / `mixins.RetrieveModelMixin` for read endpoints. `pagination_class = None` while fixture sizes stay small.
- Tests use `pytest-django`. Every endpoint gets a smoke test that asserts status 200 + camelCase key presence.
- Models with string PKs match the frontend's seeded IDs (`LD-NNNNN`, `NRG-NNNNN`, `CL-LIVE-NNN`, `PAY-NNNNN`, etc.) so the cutover from mock to backend is bit-identical.
- The seed command must remain deterministic and idempotent.

### TypeScript / React

- **No `any`** in app code. Use generics + `unknown` at boundaries.
- Use **Zod** for schema validation at boundaries.
- Define props with named `interface` / `type`. Don't use `React.FC`.
- Animate compositor-friendly properties only (`transform`, `opacity`).
- Prefer **Vitest + React Testing Library**. Visual regression is Phase 6+.
- Component files stay under ~400 lines (split when bigger).
- No `console.log` left in committed code (use proper warnings only).

### Style

- Tailwind tokens. Premium Ayurveda + AI SaaS theme: deep green / emerald / teal / saffron-gold / ivory / charcoal. Rounded cards, soft shadows, clean typography, strong hierarchy.
- Director should grok business health in 30 seconds. Not an admin template.

### Git

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`.
- Commit at every checkpoint that leaves the repo green (build + lint + test).
- **Never** `git push --force` to `main`. Never skip hooks (`--no-verify` is forbidden unless the user explicitly authorizes).
- One feature per branch when working on Phase 2+.

## Common commands

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_demo_data --reset
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
python -m pytest -q                 # 107 tests today

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                         # http://localhost:8080
npm test                            # 8 tests today
npm run lint                        # 0 errors expected
npm run build                       # production build
```

Quick health check before any large change:
```bash
cd backend && python -m pytest -q && python manage.py check
cd frontend && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build
```

## When adding things

| Task | What to touch |
| --- | --- |
| New API endpoint | `backend/apps/<app>/{models,serializers,views,urls}.py` + smoke test in `backend/tests/test_endpoints.py` + matching call in `frontend/src/services/api.ts` |
| New Django app | Add to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `backend/config/settings.py` + mount URL in `backend/config/urls.py` + create `apps/<name>/{__init__,apps,models,serializers,views,urls,admin}.py` |
| New audit-ledger event | `backend/apps/audit/signals.py` (add `@receiver(post_save, sender=...)` + `ICON_BY_KIND` entry) |
| New frontend page | New file in `frontend/src/pages/` + add route in `App.tsx` + add nav item in `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` + use `api` service only |
| New shared TS type | `frontend/src/types/domain.ts` + matching serializer with `source=` mapping |

---

## Don't do this

- Don't import `mockData.ts` from a page or component. Use `api`.
- Don't add `console.log` to production paths.
- Don't add `any` to TypeScript when `unknown` + a narrow would work.
- Don't add Supabase, Firebase, or any other backend service. Backend is Django + DRF, period.
- Don't hard-code medical claims in any file. They live in `apps.compliance.Claim`.
- Don't write to the database from CAIO endpoints. CAIO is read/audit only.
- Don't add a real third-party integration without confirming credentials & sandbox setup with Prarit first. **Razorpay (2B), Delhivery (2C), Vapi (2D), and Meta Lead Ads (2E) are shipped** — `RAZORPAY_MODE`, `DELHIVERY_MODE`, `VAPI_MODE`, and `META_MODE` each accept `mock|test|live` and flip to test/live once real credentials are in `backend/.env`. PayU and WhatsApp still need creds before any wiring lands.
- Don't push to `main` without running tests + build + lint locally first.
- Don't `git push --force`. Don't skip hooks. Don't amend pushed commits.

## When in doubt

1. Read `nd.md` (the project handoff). Section index is at the top.
2. Read the relevant blueprint section (`Nirogidhara AI Command Center — Master Blueprint v1.0`, PDF in repo).
3. Run the health check above.
4. Ask Prarit before doing anything that touches: ad budgets, real medical claims, payment flows, customer messaging, kill-switch states, or production data.

The blueprint wins. Every decision in this codebase traces back to a section there.
